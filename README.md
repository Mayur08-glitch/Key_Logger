🔐 Educational Keylogger Project

📌 Overview

This project is a **Python-based keylogger** developed strictly for **educational and cybersecurity research purposes**. It demonstrates how keystroke logging techniques work at the operating system level and helps learners understand how attackers capture user input.

The main objective of this project is to:

* Study malware behavior
* Understand endpoint monitoring risks
* Learn defensive security mechanisms
* Improve detection and prevention strategies

⚠️ **This project is intended for use in controlled lab environments only.**

🎯 Purpose of the Project

Keylogging is a common technique used in cyber attacks to capture sensitive information such as passwords, messages, and personal data. By building and analyzing a keylogger, cybersecurity students can:

* Understand attacker methodologies
* Learn how malicious software operates
* Study system-level event monitoring
* Improve defensive detection skills
* Explore digital forensics concepts

This project is part of my cybersecurity learning journey.

 🛠️ Technologies Used

* Python
* System Event Handling Libraries
* File Handling & Logging Mechanisms
* Basic System Monitoring Concepts

🧠 Learning Outcomes

Through this project, I gained understanding of:

* How keystrokes can be captured programmatically
* How logged data can be stored securely
* Risks associated with endpoint compromise
* Importance of endpoint detection & response (EDR)
* Ethical considerations in cybersecurity research
